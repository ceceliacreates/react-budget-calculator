# A budget calculator app built with React (work in progress)

This is the next iteration of the [BudgetBasic calculator](https://github.com/ceceliacreates/budget_calculator) built with JQuery.

[Hosted on GitHub Pages](https://ceceliacreates.github.io/react-budget-calculator/)

I used [this tutorial](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) to set up GitHub Pages deployment

Features to add:

* More helpful results information
* Additional styling
* Form input validation
* Customized resources based on results

Recent updates:

* Modularization of components (6/14/19)
* Renders results (6/14/19)
* Auto-focus first field on each page for accesibility (6/17/19)

Comments and contributions welcome! This will ultimately be a part of a larger personal financial literacy resource web app.
